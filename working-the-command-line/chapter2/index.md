## Linux

On Linux the most common way to install packages is with [`apt-get`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJgXqQvqaIM&list=PLA2578BDE9CB9AAB3&index=34). You can also use [`brew` on Linux](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux) and [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) on Windows.

## Windows

[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) is the closest match for `apt-get` on Linux and `brew` on macOS.

## macOS

On macOS the most popular package manager is [`brew`](https://brew.sh/).

## Python

If you have chosen, or want to experiment, with Python to write command line utilities, ["Automating the boring stuff"](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) is a great resource for this.

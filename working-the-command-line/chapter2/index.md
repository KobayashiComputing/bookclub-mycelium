On Linux the most common way to install packages are using [`apt-get`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJgXqQvqaIM&list=PLA2578BDE9CB9AAB3&index=34).
You can also use [`brew` on Linux](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux) and [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) on Windows.
